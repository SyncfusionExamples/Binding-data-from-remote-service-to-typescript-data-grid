# WebApiAdaptor in Syncfusion Grid Component

The WebApiAdaptor is an extension of the ODataAdaptor, designed to interact with Web APIs created with OData endpoints. This adaptor ensures seamless communication between Syncfusion Grid and OData-endpoint based Web APIs, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation. For successful integration, the endpoint must be capable of understanding OData-formatted queries sent along with the request.
